# LIRI APP
**Terminal app that allows you to get 3 types of info.**

1) Concerts and concert locations for your choice of artist
2) Name of Artists who sing a song of your choice
3) Movie information about a movie of your choice

By typing one of the following commands **after typing "node liri.js**, it will give you the information listed above, respectively:
A) `concert-this` + <name of band>
B) `spotify-this` + <name of song>
C) `movie-this` + <name of movie>

And lastly: 

D) `do-what-it-says`

This will actually read a file and literally do what it says.


# The way it works

Open the app in terminal and begin by typing "node liri.js <one of the 4 options> and <your inquiry>

`concert-this` should look something like this:
